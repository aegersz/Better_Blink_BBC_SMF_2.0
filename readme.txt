[color=red][size=18pt]Better Blink BBCode[/size][/color][hr]

With this mod, you can blink text in posts on your forum.

Usage:

Default blink rate is 2 seconds when called as below:

([nobbc][blink]Text[/blink][/nobbc])

To change the blink rate to, for example, 7 seconds:

[nobbc][blink=7]Text[/blink][/nobbc]

Note:

Check to see if you have any other older blink BBC mods on first
as they may need uninstalling or disabling.

Note: the gif file is borrowed from the blinkbbc_1-0 mod
